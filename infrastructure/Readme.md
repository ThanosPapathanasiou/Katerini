This folder contains the tools needed to release the solution to production as well as have it run on your local machine.

The only other code (outside of this folder) that we need to be aware of is:
- the dockerfiles of each project
- the build.fsx file 

**There should be no other code that looks like 'Devops' outside of this folder.**
